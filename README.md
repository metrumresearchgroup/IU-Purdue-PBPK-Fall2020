# Getting Started

- Make sure you have R and Rstudio installed before class
- Clone this repository to your local machine by typing the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone <repository url>
```
- The file `pkgr.yml` has a list of all packages we will need for our sessions. Make sure you install these packages before class. It is up to you how to install these packages but you can use the package `pkgr` (instructions are here https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pkgr). Note: make sure you are working within the project environment by double-clicking the file `IU-Purdue-PBPK-Fall2020.Rproj`
